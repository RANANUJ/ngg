# UPI ID Management Feature - Enhanced

## Overview
The app now supports adding custom UPI IDs for donations with **smart app recognition** and **proper app icons**. Users can add their own UPI IDs (like Amazon Pay, Paytm, etc.) and the app will automatically recognize the UPI provider and show appropriate icons.

## ✨ Latest Improvements

### 1. Smart App Recognition
- **Automatic Detection**: App automatically detects UPI provider from domain
  - `username@apl` → Amazon Pay (with orange background)
  - `username@paytm` → Paytm (with blue background)  
  - `username@ybl` → PhonePe (with purple background)
  - `username@okaxis` → Google Pay (with blue background)

### 2. Proper App Icons
- **Amazon Pay Icon**: Shows `amazonpay.png` for Amazon Pay UPI IDs
- **PhonePe Icon**: Shows `phonepe.png` for PhonePe UPI IDs
- **Google Pay Icon**: Shows `googlepay.png` for Google Pay UPI IDs
- **App-specific Colors**: Each UPI provider gets its brand color as background

### 3. UI Improvements
- **Removed Duplicate**: Eliminated duplicate "Other UPI Apps" option
- **Cleaner Layout**: Streamlined payment method selection
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Custom UPI IDs display between standard options

## Features Implemented

### 1. Add New UPI ID Screen
- **Location**: `lib/screens/add_upi_screen.dart`
- **Purpose**: Allows users to add custom UPI IDs with display names
- **Validation**: Validates UPI ID format (username@provider)
- **Storage**: Saves UPI IDs to local storage using SharedPreferences

### 2. Custom UPI Service
- **Location**: `lib/services/custom_upi_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Store and retrieve custom UPI IDs
  - Auto-detect UPI app based on domain (e.g., @paytm → Paytm)
  - Provide appropriate app icons and package names
  - Remove UPI IDs functionality

### 3. Enhanced UPI Payment Screen
- **Updated**: `lib/screens/upi_payment_screen.dart`
- **New Features**:
  - Displays custom UPI IDs in the payment method list
  - Shows appropriate app icons for each UPI provider
  - "Add new UPI ID" button that navigates to the add screen
  - Automatic reload of custom UPI IDs after adding new ones

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Open Payment Methods**: User clicks "Pay via UPI" in donation screen
2. **Choose Payment Method**: Payment methods screen shows:
   - AutoPay (SBI)
   - GPay
   - PhonePe
   - Other UPI Apps
   - **[Custom UPI IDs]** ← New feature
   - **Add new UPI ID** ← New feature

3. **Add New UPI ID**: When user clicks "Add new UPI ID":
   - Opens new screen with text fields for UPI ID and display name
   - Validates UPI ID format
   - Saves to local storage
   - Returns to payment screen with new UPI ID listed

4. **Use Custom UPI ID**: Custom UPI IDs appear in the list with:
   - Display name (e.g., "My Amazon Pay")
   - UPI ID shown as subtitle
   - Appropriate app icon based on domain
   - PAY button to initiate payment

### Technical Implementation

#### UPI ID Detection
The system automatically detects the UPI app based on domain:
- `@paytm` → Paytm
- `@apl` → Amazon Pay  
- `@ybl` → PhonePe
- `@okaxis` → Google Pay
- And more...

#### Data Storage
```dart
// Custom UPI IDs are stored as JSON in SharedPreferences
[
  {
    "upiId": "user@paytm",
    "displayName": "My Paytm",
    "addedAt": "2025-08-20T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

#### Icon Mapping
Icons are automatically assigned based on UPI domain:
- Uses existing icons: `googlepay.png`, `phonepe.png`, `logo.png`
- Falls back to default icon for unknown providers

## Example Usage

### Adding Amazon Pay UPI
1. Click "Add new UPI ID"
2. Enter UPI ID: `username@apl`
3. Enter Display Name: `My Amazon Pay`
4. Click "Add UPI ID"
5. Returns to payment screen
6. "My Amazon Pay" now appears in the UPI options list

### Payment Flow
1. Select custom UPI option
2. Click PAY button
3. App launches appropriate UPI app (e.g., Amazon app for @apl)
4. User completes payment in the UPI app
