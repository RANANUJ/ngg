# Login Flow Test

## Issue Analysis

The user is experiencing an issue where after successful login, the app redirects to the onboarding screen instead of the appropriate dashboard (NGO dashboard or volunteer dashboard).

## Root Cause

Based on the code analysis, I found several potential issues in the navigation flow:

### 1. Router Redirect Logic
The router's redirect function in `main.dart` was not providing enough debugging information to understand what was happening during the authentication state changes.

### 2. Navigation Method
The login and signup screens were using direct navigation (`context.go()`) instead of letting the router handle the redirection automatically based on the authentication state.

### 3. State Propagation Timing
There might be timing issues where the router checks the authentication state before the AuthProvider has fully updated after login.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Router Debugging
- Added comprehensive debug logging in the router redirect function
- The router now logs the authentication state, user type, and current path

### 2. Updated Navigation Strategy
- Modified login and signup screens to rely on the router's automatic redirection
- Removed manual navigation calls and let the router handle routing based on auth state
- Increased delay to ensure auth state is fully propagated before router checks

### 3. Improved AuthProvider Debugging
- Added debug logging before and after `notifyListeners()` calls
- Enhanced timing to ensure state changes are properly propagated

## How to Test

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python start_server.py
   ```

2. **Run the Flutter app**:
   ```bash
   cd connect_contribute
   flutter run
   ```

3. **Test the flow**:
   - App should start with splash screen
   - Navigate to onboarding screen if not authenticated
   - Try creating a new account or logging in with existing account
   - After successful login, the router should automatically redirect to the appropriate dashboard
   - Check the console logs for detailed debugging information

## Expected Behavior

After login:
1. AuthProvider updates authentication state
2. Router redirect function detects the authentication change
3. Router automatically navigates to appropriate dashboard:
   - `/ngo-dashboard` for NGO users
   - `/volunteer-dashboard` for Individual users

## Console Debug Output

Look for these debug messages in the console:
```
Router redirect check: isLoggedIn=true, isInitialized=true, path=/login
User authenticated, redirecting to dashboard. User type: Individual
```

## Test User

A test user has been created:
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: testpass123
- Type: Individual

You can use this to test the login flow.
