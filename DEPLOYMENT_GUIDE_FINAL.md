# 🚀 NGG Campaign Fix - Step by Step Deployment Guide

## Problem Summary
Your fundraising campaigns were working locally but not showing globally because:
1. **Wrong Backend File**: Render was using `app_simple.py` (basic auth only) instead of full API
2. **Missing Campaign APIs**: Production backend didn't have campaign and donation endpoints
3. **Database Issue**: Local MongoDB vs MongoDB Atlas for production
4. **URL Priority**: Flutter app was trying local URLs first instead of production

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Production Backend (`app_production.py`)
- **Full Campaign API**: Create, read, update, delete campaigns
- **Donation System**: UPI payments, donation tracking, statistics
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Production database support
- **Cross-Platform**: NGO and Volunteer dashboard integration

### 2. Updated Flutter API Service
- **Render URL First**: Prioritizes production URL over local development
- **Automatic Fallback**: Falls back to local if production fails
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved connection retry logic

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Render Service

1. **Go to your Render Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://render.com/dashboard
   - Find your NGG service

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   ```
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/connect_contribute
   SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production
   FLASK_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Connect to GitHub Repository**
   - Ensure your Render service is connected to: https://github.com/RANANUJ/ngg
   - Branch: `main`
   - Root Directory: `backend`

4. **Deploy Latest Changes**
   - Render should automatically deploy the latest commit
   - If not, click "Manual Deploy" in your service dashboard

### Step 2: MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. **Create MongoDB Atlas Account**
   - Visit: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
   - Create free cluster

2. **Database Configuration**
   - Database name: `connect_contribute`
   - Collections will be created automatically:
     - `users` (for authentication)
     - `campaigns` (for fundraising campaigns)
     - `donation_requests` (for donation requests)
     - `donations` (for donation tracking)

3. **Network Access**
   - Go to "Network Access" in MongoDB Atlas
   - Add IP Address: `0.0.0.0/0` (allows all IPs)
   - Or add Render's specific IP ranges

4. **Get Connection String**
   - Go to "Database" > "Connect" > "Connect your application"
   - Copy the connection string
   - Replace `<password>` with your database user password
   - Use this as your `MONGO_URI` environment variable

### Step 3: Test Deployment

1. **Health Check**
   ```
   https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}`

2. **Test Endpoints**
   ```
   # Get all campaigns (should work without authentication)
   https://your-app.onrender.com/api/campaigns/all
   
   # Get all donation requests (should work without authentication)
   https://your-app.onrender.com/api/donation-requests/all
   ```

### Step 4: Test Flutter App

1. **Run Flutter App**
   ```bash
   cd connect_contribute
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Test Campaign Creation (NGO)**
   - Login as NGO user
   - Go to NGO Dashboard > Fundraising tab
   - Create a new campaign
   - Verify it appears in the list

3. **Test Campaign Visibility (Volunteer)**
   - Login as Volunteer user
   - Go to Volunteer Dashboard > Requests tab
   - Should see NGO campaigns in the list
   - Test donation functionality

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Health Check Fails
```bash
# Check Render logs in dashboard
# Common issues:
# 1. MongoDB connection string incorrect
# 2. Environment variables not set
# 3. App not using app_production.py
```

### If Campaigns Don't Appear
```bash
# 1. Check API response directly:
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/campaigns/all

# 2. Check Flutter app logs for API errors
# 3. Verify Render URL in API service matches your actual URL
```

### If Authentication Fails
```bash
# 1. Check JWT_SECRET_KEY is set in Render
# 2. Try creating new user account
# 3. Check token expiration (24 hours by default)
```
